To-Do List

Welcome to the To-Do List project! This is a simple and intuitive application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you keep track of your tasks and manage your daily activities efficiently. The application allows you to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, edit existing tasks, delete tasks, and filter tasks by their status (All, Completed, Pending). It features a responsive design, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop users.

To get started, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/manish-2412/To-Do-List/tree/main and navigate to the project directory with cd to-do-list. You can then open the index.html file in your favorite web browser to start using the application. Simply add your tasks using the input field and manage them using the provided controls.

The project structure is straightforward, with an index.html file for the interface, a styles.css file for styling, and a script.js file for functionality. Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to submit a pull request. Fork the project, create your feature branch, commit your changes, push to the branch, and open a pull request.
